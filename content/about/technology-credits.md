  Built with Hugo, Caddy, Fly.io, a customized theme, and Cartograph CF
---

This site is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), served by
[Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/), and hosted at [Fly.io](https://fly.io/).

The theme is a heavily modified version of [panr's](https://github.com/panr/)
[hugo-terminal-theme](https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal). The color
scheme is [tomorrow-night](https://github.com/chriskempson/tomorrow-theme).

The font is [Cartograph](https://connary.com/cartograph.html) by [Connary
Fagen](https://connary.com/index.html). I love this font. Please purchase a
license from Connary Fagen if you wish to use it.

You can find the sources for this blog including the theme at
