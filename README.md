# slush.systems

TODO -
- deployment
  - slush.systems domain (w/ www)
  - multi-region on fly.io

- extract 'post meta' into a partial to render it on the front page / category
  pages
- format the "description" as a tl;dr: and put it in the post meta
- extract the header styles from post into main (except on main the full thing
  should be a link)

- categories
  - setup category pages
  - category nav w/ breadcrumbs instead of the 'about' & 'showcase' links

- about page

- remove the top & bottom borders from the code blocks -- unneeded since we're
  using a darker background & it makes the corners look weird

TODONE -
- cartograph font
- deployment
  - single region on fly.io
