# slush.systems

TODO -
- properly colored favicons -- most are missing, others are the old colors &
  clash
- where the hell are the extra spaces around the tags coming from in post-meta?
- ci/cd
  - github actions deployment
    - eventually would like PRs to deploy to a dev version of the site (maybe on
      a subdomain?)
    - and merges to main should deploy main

- categories
  - setup category pages
  - category nav w/ breadcrumbs instead of the 'about' & 'showcase' links

TODONE -
- slush.systems domain (w/ www)
- multi-region on fly.io
- about page
- extract 'post meta' into a partial to render it on the front page / category
  pages
- format the "description" as a tl;dr: and put it in the post meta
- extract the header styles from post into main (except on main the full thing
  should be a link)

- cartograph font
- deployment
  - single region on fly.io
- remove the top & bottom borders from the code blocks -- unneeded since we're
  using a darker background & it makes the corners look weird
